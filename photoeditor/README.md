<br>
To compile the app, 
<br>
make sure you have node installed in your system.
<br> 
If not, 
<br>
click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install node. 
<br>
I recommend node LTS but feel free to use any version. 
<br>
Select the operating system you want node to be installed, 
<br>
and go through the installation.
<br>
If you are unsure whether you have node installed on your system, 
<br>
type the following command.

#### `node --version`
If you don't get any errors, 
<br>
and get an version number, for example
<br>
#####   `v14.15.0`
then you have node installed in your system.
<br>
If you get an error, for example "command not found", then download node as given in the above steps.👆🏻
<br>
<br>
After node is installed in your system, you can download the code of the repo(Either by using git, or github). However, I am using github, just to keep it simple. Click [here](https://github.com/AkkiSeven/AkkiSeven.github.io) to open my github repo, and then click the download code button as given below.👇🏼

<br>
This will download a zip file in your computer. 
<br>
<br>
Unzip the file to wherever you want to save it.
<br>
Then open the "📁akkiseven.github.io📁" folder in your terminal or command prompt.
<br>
<br>
Then type the following command:
### `cd photoeditor`
<br>
Almost finished!
<br>
Since you installed node, you get a command called npm. Enter the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

### `npm install`

this will take approximately 2 minutes to run.
<br>
After this finishes, type the following command:

### `npm start`

after a few seconds, you should get the CoEdit website up and running!
<br>
<br>
You can now edit the code!

<br>

The code is successfully compiled!
