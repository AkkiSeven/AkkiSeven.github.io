  <h1>Essay about Moderates and Radicals</h1>
  <h5>By Akshay Madhira</h5>
  <br />
  <p>
    Even though there were many revolts and rebellions that took place before
    1857,
    <br />
    the Rise of Nationalism gave birth to the National Movement and resulted in
    the formation of the INC(Indian National Congress) in 1885.
    <br />
    Based on the history, we can observe there were two phases of the INC, the
    Moderates, and the Radicals. In this essay, I am going to compare and
    contrast the Moderates and the Radicals, and I would like to convey my
    reasons, why I like the Radicals approach better.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Moderates, which was the early phase of INC, did not oppose the British.
    They embraced the method of prayers, petitions, and persuasion. They wanted
    more representation of Indians in the government bodies and reforms in
    approval of the Indians.  The Moderates desired that through all these
    methods, the British government would acknowledge the demands and gradually
    India would become free. Even though the Moderates intention is to get
    independence, their approach may not work with the British, as they are not
    opposing them, and ultimately they may never give in.
    <br />
    <br />
    In contrast, the Radicals wanted Indians to rely on their own strength. They
    challenge British rule through stronger methods such as boycotts, strikes,
    swadeshi, and national education. The likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the
    radicals in INC, helped Gandhi in launching the Non-cooperation Movement. As
    we all know, Gandhi's freedom fight, gave India its independence.
    <br />
    <br />
    In conclusion, I support the Radicals approach, because I believe their
    efforts were more effective against the British, especially Non-cooperative
    Movements.
